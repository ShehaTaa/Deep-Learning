# Deep-Learning
This repository deep learning models based on Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms as CNN, LSTM, SOM, and Boltzmann Machines (BM).

## This program consists of 6 main parts:-

### Part 1: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  - **Project:-**
       build a classifier model to predict if the customer will continue in the bank or not.
### Part 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - **Project:-**
       Build an image classifier based on convolution neural network **CNN**.  
### Part 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  - **Project:-** 
       Build a time series model based on long short term memory **LSTM** to predict google stock price.  
### Part 4: Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
  - **Project:-** 
       Build a fraud detection model to detect potential fraud within credit card applications 
       based on self organized map **SOM**. 
### Part 5: Boltzmann Machines (BM)
### Part 6: AutoEncoders (AE)
