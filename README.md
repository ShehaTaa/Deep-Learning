# Deep-Learning
This repository deep learning models based on Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms as CNN, LSTM, SOM, and Boltzmann Machines (BM).

## This program consists of 6 main parts:-

### Part 1: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  **Project:-**
      The prediction of the customerâ€™s state in the bank, will continue or not.
### Part 2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
### Part 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
### Part 4: Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
### Part 5: Boltzmann Machines (BM)
### Part 6: AutoEncoders (AE)
